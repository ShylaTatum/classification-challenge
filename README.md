## Logistic Regression

The first model is a logistic regression that analyzes how accurately spam can be identified based on 
the model after training. 

## Random Forest

The second model is a random forest that is trained on the same data. It also is identifying whether 
or not an item is spam. Both models were scored and the logistic regression was the more accurate model.
